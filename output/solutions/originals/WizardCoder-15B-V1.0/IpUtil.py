```

The `is_valid_ipv4` and `is_valid_ipv6` methods use the `socket` module to check if the given IP address is valid. The `get_hostname` method uses the `gethostbyaddr` method of the `socket` module to retrieve the hostname associated with the given IP address. If the IP address is invalid or there is no hostname associated with it, the method returns `None`.
