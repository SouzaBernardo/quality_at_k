### Response:The class JSONProcessor is defined with three methods: read_json, write_json, and process_json. The read_json method reads a JSON file and returns the data. The write_json method writes data to a JSON file and saves it to the given path. The process_json method reads a JSON file, removes a specified key from the data, and writes the modified data back to the file.

Here's the implementation of the class:

```python
import json
import os

class JSONProcessor:
    """
    This is a class to process JSON file, including reading and writing JSON files, as well as processing JSON data by removing a specified key from the JSON object.

        :return: dict, the data from the JSON file if read successfully, or return -1 if an error occurs during the reading process.
                    return 0 if the file does not exist.
        """
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            return 0
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                data = json.load(f)
            return data
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error reading JSON file: {e}")
            return -1

    def write_json(self, data, file_path):
        """

        :param data: dict, the data to be written to the JSON file.
        :param file_path: str, the path of the JSON file.
        :return: 1 if the writing process is successful, or -1, if an error occurs during the writing process.
        """
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                json.dump(data, f)
            return 1
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error writing JSON file: {e}")
            return -1

    def process_json(self, file_path, remove_key):
        """

        :param file_path: str, the path of the JSON file.
        :param remove_key: str, the key to be removed.
        :return: 1, if the specified key is successfully removed and the data is written back.
                    0, if the file does not exist or the specified key does not exist in the data.
        """
        if not os.path.exists(file_path):
            return 0
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                data = json.load(f)
            if remove_key in data:
                del data[remove_key]
                with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
                    json.dump(data, f)
                return 1
            else:
                return 0
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing JSON file: {e}")
            return -1
```

The read_json method checks if the file exists and reads the data using the json.load method. If an error occurs during the reading process, it prints an error message and returns -1.

The write_json method writes the data to the JSON file using the json.dump method. If an error occurs during the writing process, it prints an error message and returns -1.

The process_json method reads the data from the JSON file using the json.load method. If the specified key exists in the data, it removes the key using the del keyword and writes the modified data back to the file using the json.dump method. If the specified key does not exist in the data, it returns 0. If an error occurs during the processing process, it prints an error message and returns -1.
