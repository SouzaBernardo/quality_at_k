### Response:The class `SignInSystem` is implemented correctly. The `add_user` method adds a user to the `self.users` dictionary if the user doesn't already exist, and sets their initial state to `False`. The `sign_in` method sets the state of the user to `True` if the user exists in the `self.users` dictionary. The `check_sign_in` method checks if the user exists in the `self.users` dictionary and if their state is `True`. The `all_signed_in` method checks if all users in the `self.users` dictionary have a state of `True`. The `all_not_signed_in` method returns a list of usernames that have a state of `False`.
